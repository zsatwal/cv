  <p>  How to structure text in html
The first thing we want is a header <h1> for header 1. content is placed inside
the angular opening and closing.Headers are from h1 - h6 with decreasing font
size</p>
   We have <p></p> for paragraph. Matter is placed in between the angular
   brackets

   For italicise we can use <em> or <i> with em being preferred
   For bold use <b>< or <strong></strong> tags with strong tag preferred.
